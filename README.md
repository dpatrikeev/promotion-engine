# About 
The promotion engine will need to calculate the total order value after applying
the 2 promotion types:
* buy 'n' items of a SKU for a fixed price (3 A's for 130)
* buy SKU1 & SKU2 for a fixed price (C+D=30)

The promotion engine should be modular to allow for more promotion types to be added at a later date (e.g. a future promotion could be x% of a SKU unit price).

# Install & Run
```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn test
```

Should contain 3 test suites and 17 unit tests.
